# Yahtzee
Just the typical Yahtzee game

Only the "Roll Dice" button works at this moment.<br>
<br>
Press the "Roll Dice" button to create randomly generated dice numbers.<br>
Above the button it will say what you rolled (ie. Full House, 3 of a Kind etc.)<br>
<br>
<br>
ToDo:<br>
Add code for high number (now when there is no pair, full house or straight etc. it will say that you have one pair, when you don't)<br>
Create code for the "Hold" button.<br>
Create code for the scores.<br>
Create code for the "Game #" button<br>
Create code for the other buttons (numbers and 3 of a kind etc.)<br>
