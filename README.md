# Yahtzee
Just the typical Yahtzee game

The game is playable at this moment, although the dice can not be "Hold" yet<br>
<br>
Press the "Roll Dice" button to create randomly generated dice numbers.<br>
Above the button it will say what you rolled (ie. Full House, 3 of a Kind etc.)<br>
At this point you have to manually type in the score results.<br>
<br>
<br>
ToDo:<br>
Create code for the "Hold" button.<br>
<br>
For making it a bit more user friendly:<br>
Create code for the scores. (ie. auto calculation of the scores)<br>
Create code for the "Game #" button. (ie. switching between games (not sure if this will be added at all))<br>
Create code for the other buttons (numbers and 3 of a kind etc.) that when you have a pair of sixes, you can press<br>
the "sixes" button and it will put the sum of those sixes inside the inputfield for the sixes.<br>
